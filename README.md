Introduction:
  Kali Linux:
    A Linux distribution with Debian roots called Kali Linux is made for penetration testing and digital forensics. Offensive Security oversees and provides maintenance     for it.Kali Linux offers 600 penetration-testing applications, including Armitage, Nmap, Wireshark, John the Ripper, sqlmap, Aircrack-ing, Burp, and OWASP ZAP.
    It was created by Offensive Security employees Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns through the rewriting of BackTrack, a Linux distribution they had previously used for       information security testing and which was based on Knoppix. The Hindu deity Kali served as the name's inspiration.
  
 Honeypot:
   Honeypotss are network-attached systems used by hackers to identify and research tactics and types of attacks. Large businesses and cybersecurity-related                organisations are the main users, but crooks may use them to hoodwink researchers and disseminate false information.
   
  PenTBox:
    PenTBox is a security suite that can be used in penetration testing engagements to perform a variety of activities.Specifically these activities include from             cracking hashes,DNS enumeration and stress testing to HTTP directory brute force.

Stepwise Demonstration:

To set up a honeypot in our Kali Linux system we need to download a tool from GitHub it called Pentbox. This tool is written in ruby language. To download this we use the following command: git clone https://www.github.com/technicaldada/pentbox
