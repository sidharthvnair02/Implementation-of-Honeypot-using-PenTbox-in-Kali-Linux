Introduction:
  Kali Linux:
    A Linux distribution with Debian roots called Kali Linux is made for penetration testing and digital forensics. Offensive Security oversees and provides maintenance     for it.Kali Linux offers 600 penetration-testing applications, including Armitage, Nmap, Wireshark, John the Ripper, sqlmap, Aircrack-ing, Burp, and OWASP ZAP.
    It was created by Offensive Security employees Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns through the rewriting of BackTrack, a Linux distribution they had previously used for       information security testing and which was based on Knoppix. The Hindu deity Kali served as the name's inspiration.
  
 Honeypot:
   Honeypotss are network-attached systems used by hackers to identify and research tactics and types of attacks. Large businesses and cybersecurity-related                organisations are the main users, but crooks may use them to hoodwink researchers and disseminate false information.
   
  PenTBox:
    PenTBox is a security suite that can be used in penetration testing engagements to perform a variety of activities.Specifically these activities include from             cracking hashes,DNS enumeration and stress testing to HTTP directory brute force.

Stepwise Demonstration:

To set up a honeypot in our Kali Linux system we need to download a tool from GitHub it called Pentbox. This tool is written in ruby language. To download this we use the following command: git clone https://www.github.com/technicaldada/pentbox

Then we need to go into the pentbox folder by using cd command as following:
cd pentbox

Here we have a compressed file named pentbox.tar.xz and to extract itwe apply following command:
tar -xzvf pentbox.tar.gz

Then we can see a new folder in this directory by using ls command:
ls
Now we go to the pentbox-1.8 directory and check the files using following command:
cd pentbox-1.8 && ls

Then we run this ruby tool by using simple command as following:
./pentbox.rb

Here we need to go to the Network tools option so type 2 and hit Enter.

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82643868/220172448-14433087-fd87-493c-880a-cbd54df9cb86.png)

Yes, now we can see the Honeypot option so we go for it by choosing option 3.


Here we can choose 1 for auto configuration this will be fast or we can choose 2 for manual configuration. Manual configuration contains more options but it is for advanced users. For learning we choose the option 1 and hit Enter.
Now we can see that we have successfully run honeypot in our localhost on port 80. To check how it works we can go to browser and check our localhost that is 127.0.0.1:80 and then check in the terminal where we started honeypot it will shows the information about him/her who have opened our localhost.
